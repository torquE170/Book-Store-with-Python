# EJ-ITFactory-Python-Project

###### A CLI experience with login and user management for keeping records of user defined items.
### As a logged in administrator you can:
1) Manage users(list, add, remove, promote, demote, user status - active/deactivated)

## Config file
A ini config file, that: 
1) Sets connect data for a mysql server. 
2) Sets getpass() as function for reading password when in terminal 
and uses "clear" commands for windows and linux

## Next steps
1) Make a txt log file with login time, date and a unique session id so the app keeps a record
2) Add a parameter in the config file to just use a sqlite3 db, so the app can be used without a mysql server
3) Add ability for a user to add a database completely defined by him 
   1) Add the ability for a user to manipulate entries in that database
