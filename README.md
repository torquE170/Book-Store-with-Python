# EJ-ITFactory-Python-Project

###### A CLI experience with login and user management for a yet to be determined purpose.
### As a logged in administrator you can:
1) Manage users(list, add, remove, promote, demote, user status - active/deactivated)

## Config file
A ini config file, that: 
1) Sets connect data for a mysql server. 
2) Sets getpass() as function for reading password when in terminal 
and uses "clear" commands for windows and linux

## Next steps
1) Make a txt log file with login time, date and a unique session id so the app keeps a record
2) Add a parameter in the config file to just use a sqlite3 db, so there is no need for a mysql server
3) Figure out what to do as a logged in user
